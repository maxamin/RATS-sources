I have decided to release the PsyRAT2 source as-is, because I don't feel like finishing, and I will not be coding anything to be released in this scene anymore. This doesn't mean I'm leaving, I just won't be coding.

Credits:
* I used screenshot source from some bot to get the screenshot, then used a JPEG library given to me by ksv to compress.
* Everybody else that helped fix problems.
* I honestly can't remember where else I obtained code/concepts from, so don't whine at me.

rar has been edited, please overwrite your original copy with the new version

Note: You need BC++ to open the client source, and VC++ 6 to open the server source.

This is being released without a license, so basically do what you wish with it. I just ask that you don't gain profit off of it, or say that you made it.

Also, no need to remind me my code is messy, because I know it is already
