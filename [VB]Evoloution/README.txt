Title: Evoloution
Description: Ok this is a remote administration tool. It has a lot of features, which include:
- Remote File Browsing
- Keylogger (not my code, appologies to the author I have forgotten your name)
- Chat
- Open / Close CD Tray
- Autorun on windows startup
- Email IP Address notification
- Shutdown Remote Computer
- Hide Task Bar
- Disable start Button
.. And a few more
There are no malicious features built into this program, well not this version anyway, as I wanted it to be used to learn how to interact with another machine over a LAN or over the internet, and not to be used as a means to be malicious. If you want to edit the code, to be malicious then, basically its fool on you, because that is just plain Dumb. I would appreachiate any votes that you might give me, and would definatly like feedback. Thanks in Advance and I hope this helps you - Mick
