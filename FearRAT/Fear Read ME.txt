Description: 
I made this because many people where asking
me to make a Trojan example like netbus or sub 7. 
This is in no way like either of them, but it does show 
you the basics and you could easily make it just as 
good as the top of the line trojans. I am planning to
make a next version of this example in Delphi 5
so there will be no runtime files.

I hope you like it!
