f0xit Backdoor v0.1 is reverse connect but not FWB+ (for future versions ;) ) 
-> Download file from internet (via url)
-> keylogger
-> send ftp commands
-> command prompt (Shell)

tape "exit" to stop the connection, 

timing, all the 3 minutes, the server is trying to connect to the host 
(in this example, 127.0.0.1 (localhost) ) 

tape "!help" if you want to know how to use the commands 

if you want to do a "dir" on other folders, you have to do : dir ..\ or dir ..\..\
